You are given four items:
1. Original Input X: {prompt}
2. Good Answer: {good_res}
3. Bad Answer: {bad_res}
4. Optimized Input X: {optimized_prompt}

────────────────────────────────────────
The Optimized Input X is crafted for the original Input X by comparing and analyzing the Good Answer and Bad Answer from the perspectives of accuracy, usefulness, and harmlessness, so that it can elicit a high-quality answer on par with the good response instead of the bad response.

────────────────────────────────────────
Your task is to:

1. Analyze the differences between the Good Answer and the Bad Answer.
   - Carefully read both answers.
   - Describe qualitatively the major differences between them.
   - Focus on three aspects:
     1. **Correctness**: factual accuracy, logical validity, and truthfulness
     2. **Helpfulness**: relevance, completeness, practical usefulness, clarity of communication
     3. **Harmlessness**: safety, neutrality, avoidance of bias, inappropriate content, or misinformation
   - Highlight what the Good Answer achieves better and what the Bad Answer fails to accomplish.
   - Produce a short paragraph summarizing the key qualitative gaps without assigning any numeric scores.

2. Analyze the differences between the Original Input X and the Optimized Input X.
   - Carefully compare the two inputs.
   - Freely describe any meaningful differences you observe in natural language.
   - Do not restrict yourself to predefined aspects; focus on whatever changes or improvements you find significant based on your judgment.

3. Summarize the improvements needed for Supplementary Instructions.
   - Based on insights from Step 1 (Answer comparison) and Step 2 (Input comparison), infer what kind of supplementary instructions would best help steer the model toward producing a Good Answer rather than a Bad Answer.
   - Identify key elements that should be explicitly included or reinforced in the Supplementary Instructions.
   - Write a concise synthesis paragraph summarizing these points.

4. Finally, produce the Supplementary Instructions.
   - Using the conclusions from the previous steps, create one single paragraph covering exactly the nine categories listed below, in the specified order, separated by semicolons (;).
   - Write in full sentences, without any line breaks inside the paragraph.

────────────────────────────────────────
Your paragraph must cover the following **nine categories** in the order shown, separated by semicolons:

* Role: Specify the perspective or the expert persona (e.g., “professor,” “domain expert in the (field),” “consultant”) that the model should adopt.
* Audience: Define who the answer is intended for (e.g., “general reader,” “primary school student,” “domain expert”).
* User Intent: Capture the underlying purpose behind the input (e.g., “information-seeking,” “creative writing,” “problem solving,” “decision support,” “comparative analysis,” “persuasive writing,” “data transformation,” “summarization,” or “lesson planning,” ... ect)
* Tone Type: Indicate the preferred tone or manner of speech (e.g., “formal,” “casual,” “encouraging,” “humorous”).
* Constraints: List any content or formatting restrictions (e.g., “avoid bias,” “preserve neutrality”).
* Reasoning Guidance: Indicate the preferred reasoning style (e.g., “step-by-step deduction,” “chain-of-thought (show your work),” “simple and clear,” “executive summary,” “evidence-citation style,” “mathematical derivation,” “analogical explanation with examples,” or “bullet-point reasoning.”)
* Output Format: Define the desired output style (e.g., “summary,” “bullet points,” “table,” “code block”).
* Interactive Mode: Indicate if the model may ask clarification questions—e.g., “not encouraged,” “allowed at the end of response,” or “encouraged at most one follow-up.” If allowed, the question must come *only after delivering the full answer* and appear on the final line.
